Using the Finger Scanners to confirm the Arrival and Departure 

Your attention is drawn to Public Administration Circular 09/2009 dated 16.04.2009 and Public 

Administration Circular 09/2009(I) dated 17.06.2009 issued on the above matter. 

 

02. 

Even  though  instructions  and  provisions  have  been  stipulated  in  the  above  Circulars  to 

keep records to confirm the arrival and departure of public officers to and from offices by using 

finger scanners in all Public Institutions, it has been reported that certain Government Institutions 

have not yet taken steps to implement the said system. 

 

03. 

It has also been proposed under number 373 of the budget proposals 2017  presented by 

Hon. Minister of Finance to use the finger scanners to mark staff attendance at all Government 

Institutions.  

 

 04. 

Therefore all Government Institutions which have  failed to  implement  the above system 

so far should take action to keep records to confirm the arrival and departure of officers to and 

from the office by using finger scanners, in terms of the provisions of the Circulars mentioned in 

the first paragraph.
