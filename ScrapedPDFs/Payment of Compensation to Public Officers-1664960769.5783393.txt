Payment of Compensation to Public Officers

Your  reference  is  requested  to  Public  Administration  Circulars  21/88,

59/89 and 22/93 dated 13.07.1988, 30.11.1989 and 21.09.1993 respectively.

02.      Compensation  can  be  paid  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  the  Public
Administration  Circular  No.22/93  to  a  Public  Officer  who  suffers  an  injury
arising under the circumstances explained in paragraph 1 therein.

03.        Compensation  can  also  be  paid  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  Public
Administration  Circular  No.  21/88  to  Public  Officers  who  are  injured  while  on
duty due to terrorist violence.

04.          Public  Administration  Circular  59/89  dated  30.11.1989  provides  for  the
payment  of  compensation  to  a  Public  Officer  for  injury  or  death  caused  by
subversive  and  terrorist  activity  and  also  for  injury  or  death  occured    whether
on  duty  or  not.  The  paragraph  03  of  the  above  Circular  has  categorically
instructed  that  no  officer  is  entitled  to  relief  under  both  Public  Administration
Circulars  22/93  and  21/88  and  he  could  be  eligible  for  only  one  relief  which
is more beneficial to him.

05.          We  have  received  complaints  that  in  spite  of  clear  instructions  issued  in
Public  Administration  Circular  No.59/89,  some  persons  have  been  granted
relief  under  both  the  above  Circulars  violating  these  instructions.  Your  urgent
attention  should  be  paid  to  strictly  comply  with  the  instructions  of  the  Public
Administration Circular No.59/89.
