Preparation of Salary of the Officers who are appointed from One Service 

or Post to another Service or Post in Public Service 

 
It  is  observed  according  to  the  information  submitted  to  me  that  various  issues  arise  when 
preparing  the  salary  of  the  officers  who  are  appointed  from  one  service  or  post  to  another 
service or post in public service. 
 
02. 
Accordingly,  at  the  instances  where  a  percentage  for  recruitment  has  been  allocated 
on limited or merit basis as per the service minute or the scheme of recruitment relevant to a 
certain service or post in public service and when preparing the salary of an officer appointed 
from a service/ post prescribed to be appointed under the allocated percentage, the provisions 
of  Section  5,  Chapter  VII  of  Establishments  Code  should  be  applied  and  the  salary  of  an 
officer who has been in a certain service or post in public service at the time of appointment 
to  a  service/  post  other  than  on  limited  or  merit  basis,  should  be  prepared  as  per  the 
provisions of Section 9, Chapter VII of Establishments Code. Even though, an officer may be 
entitled to a salary lower than the salary of the previous post when calculating the salary as 
per  the  provisions  of  Section  9,  Chapter  VII  of  Establishments  Code,  it  shall  not  be 
considered as a salary anomaly.  
 

You  are  further  informed  to  notify  all  the  officers  under  your  supervision  on  these 

03. 
provisions.

                                                                                                  Secretary 
                                                                  Ministry of Public Administration and Management
