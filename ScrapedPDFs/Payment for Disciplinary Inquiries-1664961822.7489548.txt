Payment for Disciplinary Inquiries  

Your  attention  is  drawn  to  the  Public  Administration  Circular  No  19/2005(i)  dated  22.11.2011  on  the 

above matter.  

 

02.  

Requests  have  been  made  by  various  institutions  regarding  the  payment  of  allowances  for 

inquiry officers under Section 7 of the above Circular. The additional payment of Rs.3000/- can be paid 

to  the  officer  without  any  reduction  if  a  delay  has  occurred  in  handing  over  the  report  due  to  a  reason 

beyond  his  control  which  occurred  within  the  period  of  06  months  prescribed  for  handing  over  the  

report to the disciplinary authority concluding formal disciplinary inquiry and further if it is possible to 

confirm  such  situation.  However,  it  is  hereby  notified  that  when  making  the  above  payment  without     

any reductions, the disciplinary authority should clearly indicate the reasons for such decision.
