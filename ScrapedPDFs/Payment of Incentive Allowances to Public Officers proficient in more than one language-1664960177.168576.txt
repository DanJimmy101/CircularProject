Payment of Incentive Allowances to Public Officers proficient in more than one language 

 

Your  attention  is  drawn  to  Public  Administration  Circular  29/98  dated  30.12.1998  and  Public 

Administration  Circular  29/98  (I)  dated  23.06.2004  on  payment  of  incentive  allowances  for 

language proficiency, Public Administration Circular  03/2007 dated 09.02.2007 issued with the 

inclusion  of  new  provisions  with  regard  to  payment  of  incentive  allowances  for  proficiency  in 

official  languages  and  Public  Administration  Circular  07/2007  dated  28.05.2007  issued  on 

implementation  of  official  language  policy  and  the  Public  Administration  Circular  01/2014 

dated 21.01.2014 issued in place of that circular.

Even  though  it  has  been  mentioned  in  Section  5  of  Public  Administration  Circular 

07/2007 that the provisions in Public Administration Circular 03/2007 will not be applied to the 

Public  Officers  recruited  after  01.07.2007,  the  provisions  in  Public  Administration  Circular  

29/98  and 29/98  (I) can  be made applicable for the  payment of incentive allowances to  Public 

Officers recruited from 01.07.2007 and those who would be recruited in future for acquiring the 

proficiency in English, the link language.
