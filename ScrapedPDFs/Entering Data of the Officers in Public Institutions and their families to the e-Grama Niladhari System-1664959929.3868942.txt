implemented  by  the  State  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  under  the  technical  and  project 
management  consultancy  assistance  of  the  Information  and  Communication  Technology 
Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA).

Instructions  and  guidance  have  already  been  given  to  the  District  and  Divisional 
04. 
Secretaries  and  Grama  Niladharis  by  the  State  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  be  prepared  in

05. 
programme  by  the  State  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  the  Ministry  of  Public  Services, 
Provincial  Councils  and  Local  Government  to  enter  the  data  of  all  public  officers  into  the 
eGN database using an electronic method prior to the collection of the data at household level 
with  the  use  of  a  printed  data  collection  form,  with  the  aim  of  expediting  the  use  of  this 
system and to provide the benefits of the project to the public employees sooner according to 
the decision taken by Cabinet meetings held on 20.03.2019 and 29.03.2021 dated.
