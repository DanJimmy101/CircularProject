Having  taken  into  consideration  the  issues  existing  at  present  in  the  transport  system  and  the 
difficulties arisen in the maintenance of office functions during power interruption, 02 of May, 
Monday,  the  day  before  03  of  May,  Tuesday,  which  has  already  been  declared  as  a  public 
holiday, is also declared as a special holiday for government offices.
