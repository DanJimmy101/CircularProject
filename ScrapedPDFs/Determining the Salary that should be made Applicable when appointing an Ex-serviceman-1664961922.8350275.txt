Determining the Salary that should be made Applicable, 

when appointing an Ex-serviceman 

 
Your kind attention is hereby drawn to section 8, Chapter VII, Volume I of the Establishments 
Code. 
 
Even though, it is mentioned under the concessions granted to an Ex-serviceman under 
02. 
sub section 17:1 (d), Chapter II of the Establishments Code, that the provisions in Chapter VII 
of  the  Establishments  Code  should  be  made  applicable  in  determining  the  salary  of  the  said 
officer,  when  employing  such  officer  in  Public  Service  or  Public  Corporation,  no  specific 
provisions are stipulated in the said Chapter or any other Chapter of the Establishments Code 
on  the  manner  in  which  salaries  of  such  officers  should  be  prepared.  Therefore,  it  has  been 
decided  at  the  meeting  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  held  on  12.10.2020  to  revise  section  8, 
Chapter  VII  of  the  Establishments  Code  with  regard  to  the  salary  step  on  which  an  Ex-
serviceman  should  be  placed,  when  granting  an  appointment  in  Public  Service  and  include  a 
new sub section as 8:9 in the following manner 
 

“8.  Salary  on  Re-employment,  Alternative  employment,  Release  and  on 

Recruitment as an Ex-serviceman 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 

 

8:9  Salary  of  an  officer  recruited  to  the  Public  Service  or  to  a  State 
Corporation as a concession granted to an Ex-serviceman, should be adjusted 
in  line  with  the  provisions  in  Section  9  of  this  Chapter  on  the  basis  of  the 
salary the officer has earned whilst serving in the armed forces.”
