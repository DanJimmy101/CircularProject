Prevention  of  Dengue Epidemic

It    has  been  decided  to  launch  an  intensive  cleaning  programme  in  the  premises
and  surroundings  of  public  institutions  every  Thursday,  between    9.00  a.m.  and  10.00  a.m.,
as one of the steps in the national programme for eradication of Dengue epidemic.

02. Steps  should  be  taken  to  trace  the  breeding  places  of  mosquitoes,  and  such  places
should  be  kept  dry  and  tidy.   All  staff  of  the  institutions  should  also  be  made  aware  of    the
urgency to maintain their surroundings scrupulously clean.

03. This  programme  should  be  launched  with  the  participation  of  all  members  of  staff,
trade  unions,    welfare  associations  and  the  general  public,    according  to  the  announcement
made  through  the  mass  media,    by  the  Ministry  of  Healthcare,  Nutrition  and  Uva-
Wellassa  Development.    Working  Committees  may  also  be  set  up  wherever  appropriate  to
make this programme a success.

04. Please  take  steps  to  get  further  instructions  and  support  in  this  endeavour,  from
the Health authorities and the Local Government institutions of the area.
