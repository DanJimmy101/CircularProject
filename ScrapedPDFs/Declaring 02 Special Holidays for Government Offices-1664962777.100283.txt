Declaring 02 Special Holidays for Government Offices 

 

The government offices should stay open only on the 11 and 12 of April during the period 

from 08 of April to 18 of April on which the office opens after the forthcoming Sinhala and 

Tamil New Year.  

 

02.   Even though the offices are to be opened on 11 and 12 of April as above, a decline in 

the  attendance  of  officers  and  service  recipients  visiting  the  office  can  be  expected. 

Therefore, the benefit gained by keeping the offices open may be less when compared to the 
expenses to  be borne. Considering this situation  11 and 12  of  April are hereby declared  as 
two Special Holidays for public offices. 

 

03.   This should not hinder the provision of essential government services.
