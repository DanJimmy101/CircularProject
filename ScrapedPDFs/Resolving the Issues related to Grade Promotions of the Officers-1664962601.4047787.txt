Resolving the Issues related to Grade Promotions of the Officers, who have been

In  terms  of  Section  14  (ii)  (a)  of  the  Development  Officers’  Service  Minute  amended  by  the 
Gazette  Extra  Ordinary  No.  1774/31  dated  07.09.2012  and  published  in  the  Gazette  Extra 
Ordinary  No.  1745/11  dated  14.02.2012,  officers  who  have  completed  a  service  period  of  not 
less than ten (10) years, but less than twenty (20) years in a post or grade of which the salaries 
have been specified relevant to Grade III under the salary scale of MN 4- 2006(j) and satisfied 
the other requirements mentioned in the same, have been absorbed into Grade II of Development 
Officers’ Service with effect from 01.08.2011.  

02. 
In  considering  the  matters,  which  state  that  the  said  officers  have  been  prejudiced  by 
being forced to serve in a post of Grade III up to 01.08.2011 due to various reasons, even though 
they  have  completed  a  service  period  of  over  10  years,  Public  Service  Commission  have 
informed to take action in the following manner with regard to these officers. 

1.  To absorb all the officers into the Development Officers’ Service as per the provisions of  

the Service Minute. 
 

2.  To  use  the  service  period  exceeding  the  period  of  10  years  of  the  officers,  who  have 
completed  over  10  years  of  active  and  satisfactory  service  period  as  at  the  date  of 
absorption, when calculating the period of service for the next promotion (Grade I).
