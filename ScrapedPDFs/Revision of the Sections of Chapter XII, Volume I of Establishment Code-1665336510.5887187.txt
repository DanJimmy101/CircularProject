Code.

It has been decided at the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers held on 16.04.2022 to 
add  a  new  Sub  Section  to  Section  1  of  the  above  para  as  1:11  and  to  revise  Sub  Sections 
6:1:2, 8:2, 8:2:1, 10:1:4, 10:1:6 and 21:1 as follows. 
 

1:11   When granting approval for leave to an officer, who does not report for duty on 
the  first  working  day  of  the  calendar  year,  approval  should  not  be  granted  to 
cover such first working day either from the casual or vacation leave of the new 
year.  Further  leave  can  strictly  be  approved  to  such  officer  from  the  unavailed 
vacation leave of the preceding years or, if the provisions in section 10, Chapter 
XII of the Establishments Code are satisfied, from lapsed leave.

Instructions regarding the medical  certificates  are issued by the Department of 
Health Services and when leave to be spent within the Island is approved on a 
medical  certificate  for  a  period  covered  by  a  medical  certificate,  the  period  of 
such  leave  should  be  calculated  excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays  and  public 
holidays (Not specified to serve on the nature of duties) falling within the said 
period of leave. 

He may be allowed the accumulated vacation leave of two years, that is unused 
leave of the year in which he takes the leave and of the preceding year. He will 
thus  be  entitled  to    a    maximum  of  48  days  leave  in  a  year  or  in  case  of  an 
officer, who is required  to serve   07 days of the  week, he will be  entitled to a 
maximum of 56 days leave. 

8:2:1  A staff officer may be allowed the accumulated leave of three years, that is the 
year in which he takes the leave and of the two preceding years, if the leave is to 
be  spent  out  of  the  Island.  He  will,  thus  be  entitled  to  a  maximum  of  72  days 
leave or in case of a staff officer, who is required to serve 07 days of the week, 
he will be entitled to a maximum of 84 days accumulated vacation  leave. 

 
10:1:4   The  total  of  lapsed  leave  granted  to  an  officer  during  two  consecutive  years  
should not exceed his  normal quota of leave for two years, viz, 48 days and in 
case  of  an  officer,  who  is  required  to  serve  07  days  of  the  week,  such  leave 
should not exceed 56 days. 

 

 
10:1:6    In such circumstances, the total of lapsed leave granted to an officer during two 
consecutive years  should  not exceed his normal quota of leave for four years, 
viz,96  days  and  in  case  of  an  officer,  who  is  required  to  serve  07  days  of  the 
week, such leave should not exceed 112 days. 

 

 
21:1   When an officer has exhausted his  normal  vacation leave and   requires further 
leave either on grounds of his illness or an illness of a child or spouse, for which 
special attention and care should be made on the recommendation of a Medical 
Consultant, leave on half pay may be allowed subject to the following rules.
